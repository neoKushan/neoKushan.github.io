      <description>At the release of .net core 1.0, there was no way to trivially use bcrypt password hashing. A .net library existed, but it had been abandoned by the author.
I took it upon myself to port this library to .net core. I have been maintaining it ever since and it is currently the most popular bcrypt library for .net core!</description>
